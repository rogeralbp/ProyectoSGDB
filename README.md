EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 

This document will explain in detail the main objective of this project and clearly the idea in which our work group was inspired to carry out this project , a project which consists of the creation of a Database Management System which will be done so in which p hermitage manipulate all objects in a database graphically and integrates fulfilling all requirements set by the teacher in the description of the project exposed  to students before, starting with the aim of solving the problem of a company in the technological context inwhich is presented as the non-existence of a system capable of managing all the objects in a database in  addition to seeking a solution to all those problems that the Management Systems present so that they do not originate in the final version of said project. 

PRINCIPAL OBJETIVE
 

Create a Management System Database using development tools such as Systems Managers Database real and clear a programming language that in our case the elegid or for this project is C # , this project will carry it out collectively in the where each member can contribute a part to the project so that everything compiles in a good way as the only final objective .   



SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
 

 

Work in an orderly and concise manner to achieve a common goal.
 

Investigate the business logic that needs to be implemented in a SGDB .
 

Carry out the work plan previously proposed for the development of this project .
 

Develop a database administrator proposal with the main objective of generating a software tool in which different database objects can be managed by graphic means .
 

 



INTRODUCTION
 

 

In this document all components are briefly explained l project  of the course Application Databases, processing, working methodology used, the way in which we detect important turning points for the creation of this system whose In order to manage all the objects related to the context of the databases.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM
 

 

This project is to develop a proposal for a database administrator with the main aim of generating a software tool which can handle different objects in the database for a graphic medium , the proposal and implementation showed us how As a result of different windows, these windows have a high degree of importance in the compilation of the total project as such.



DEVELOPING
 

This project involved many hours of work in which we projected that a layered programming would be the best way to start developing this project so that we could put into practice the knowledge that we have acquired at the University through this course.

CONCLUSIONS
 

We conclude that the development of the DBMS is undoubtedly , processes complex and while we do recognize , rethink about how important s that are in the context technology of today 's world , the facilities n will give in addition to services .  

RECOMMENDATIONS
 

DEVELOPED SYSTEM :

- Our recommendations are to acquire a better notion of all the objects that make up a database so that this system can be of great help and that it was created as a graphical environment that is very pleasing to the eye and easy to use by We hope that you can get the most out of this software.         

 

 

FUTURE RESEARCHERS:

- For those who wish to carry out a SGDB based on this, we recommend analyzing all the details of some other REAL SGDB since it will facilitate the capture of the relevant points of this system and thus give a little more realism to the final prototype.
